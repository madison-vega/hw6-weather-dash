## Description

This is a weather dashboard to search forecasts in different cities as well as other information.  This utilizes API calls from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the data.



## Usage

You should be able to type a city into the search bar and get the current weather, UV index, and also a 5 day forecast.  It should also save that information for you to be able to navigate back if needed.
